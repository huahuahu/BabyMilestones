The BabyMilestones project is an iOS application designed to help parents track their baby's developmental milestones. The project is built using Swift and follows modern iOS development practices.
Your task is to assist in improving the agility by writing scripts, automating tasks, and enhancing the development workflow.
You have access to the codebase and can fetch files as needed. Focus on creating scripts that streamline development processes, such as build automation, testing, and deployment.

The entry for the script is located in the `./scripts` directory of the project. You can create new scripts or modify existing ones to achieve the desired improvements.
