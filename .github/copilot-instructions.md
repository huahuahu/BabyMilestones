# BabyMilestones - AI Coding Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
BabyMilestones is an iOS app for recording and tracking children's growth and development milestones. This is currently a greenfield project with no existing codebase - focus on establishing strong iOS development foundations.

## Development Context

### Project Status
- **Early Stage**: No source code exists yet - this is a fresh start
- **Platform**: iOS native app (Swift/SwiftUI expected)
- **Domain**: Child development milestone tracking
- **Resources**: Reference material available in `/resource/prc-wst-423-2022.pdf`

### Existing Tooling
The project has sophisticated AI assistance already configured:
- **Chat Modes**: `.github/chatmodes/` contains specialized prompt templates
- **Push Prompts**: `.github/prompts/` for task definition
- Use these existing tools for planning and validation before coding

## iOS Development Guidelines
## Project Overview

IceCubesApp is a multiplatform Mastodon client built entirely in SwiftUI. It's an open-source native Apple application that runs on iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and visionOS.

## Build Commands

When building, use the iPhone 17 pro simulator for iOS builds.


### Code Formatting
The project uses SwiftFormat with 2-space indentation. Configuration is in `.swiftformat`.

## Architecture

### Modular Package Structure
## Modern SwiftUI Architecture Guidelines (2025)

### Core Philosophy

- SwiftUI is the default UI paradigm - embrace its declarative nature
- Avoid legacy UIKit patterns and unnecessary abstractions
- Focus on simplicity, clarity, and native data flow
- Let SwiftUI handle the complexity - don't fight the framework
- **No ViewModels** - Use native SwiftUI data flow patterns

### Architecture Principles

#### 1. Native State Management

Use SwiftUI's built-in property wrappers appropriately:
- `@State` - Local, ephemeral view state
- `@Binding` - Two-way data flow between views
- `@Observable` - Shared state (preferred for new code)
- `@Environment` - Dependency injection for app-wide concerns

#### 2. State Ownership

- Views own their local state unless sharing is required
- State flows down, actions flow up
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
- Extract shared state only when multiple views need it

Example:
```swift
struct TimelineView: View {
    @Environment(Client.self) private var client
    @State private var viewState: ViewState = .loading

    enum ViewState {
        case loading
        case loaded(statuses: [Status])
        case error(Error)
    }

    var body: some View {
        Group {
            switch viewState {
            case .loading:
                ProgressView()
            case .loaded(let statuses):
                StatusList(statuses: statuses)
            case .error(let error):
                ErrorView(error: error)
            }
        }
        .task {
            await loadTimeline()
        }
    }

    private func loadTimeline() async {
        do {
            let statuses = try await client.getHomeTimeline()
            viewState = .loaded(statuses: statuses)
        } catch {
            viewState = .error(error)
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3. Modern Async Patterns

- Use `async/await` as the default for asynchronous operations
- Leverage `.task` modifier for lifecycle-aware async work
- Handle errors gracefully with try/catch
- Avoid Combine unless absolutely necessary

#### 4. View Composition

- Build UI with small, focused views
- Extract reusable components naturally
- Use view modifiers to encapsulate common styling
- Prefer composition over inheritance

#### 5. Code Organization

- Organize by feature (e.g., Settings/)
- Keep related code together in the same file when appropriate
- Use extensions to organize large files
- Follow Swift naming conventions consistently

### Build Verification Process
**IMPORTANT**: When editing code, you MUST:

1. Build the project after making changes using XcodeBuildMCP commands
2. Fix any compilation errors before proceeding
3. Run relevant tests if modifying existing functionality
4. Ensure code follows modern SwiftUI patterns


### Implementation Examples

#### Shared State with @Observable
```swift
@Observable
class AppAccountsManager {
    var currentAccount: Account?
    var availableAccounts: [Account] = []

    func switchAccount(_ account: Account) {
        currentAccount = account
        // Handle account switching
    }
}

// In App file
struct IceCubesApp: App {
    @State private var accountManager = AppAccountsManager()

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .environment(accountManager)
        }
    }
}
```

#### Modern Async Data Loading
```swift
struct NotificationsView: View {
    @Environment(Client.self) private var client
    @State private var notifications: [Notification] = []
    @State private var isLoading = false
    @State private var error: Error?

    var body: some View {
        List(notifications) { notification in
            NotificationRow(notification: notification)
        }
        .overlay {
            if isLoading {
                ProgressView()
            }
        }
        .task {
            await loadNotifications()
        }
        .refreshable {
            await loadNotifications()
        }
    }

    private func loadNotifications() async {
        isLoading = true
        defer { isLoading = false }

        do {
            notifications = try await client.getNotifications()
        } catch {
            self.error = error
        }
    }
}
```

### Best Practices

#### DO:
- Write self-contained views when possible
- Use property wrappers as intended by Apple
- Test logic in isolation, preview UI visually
- Handle loading and error states explicitly
- Keep views focused on presentation
- Use Swift's type system for safety
- Trust SwiftUI's update mechanism

#### DON'T:
- Create ViewModels for every view
- Move state out of views unnecessarily
- Add abstraction layers without clear benefit
- Use Combine for simple async operations
- Fight SwiftUI's update mechanism
- Overcomplicate simple features
- **Nest @Observable objects within other @Observable objects** - This breaks SwiftUI's observation system. Initialize services at the view level instead.

### Testing Strategy

- Unit test business logic in services/clients
- Use SwiftUI Previews for visual testing
- Test @Observable classes independently
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Don't sacrifice code clarity for testability

### Code Style When Editing
- Maintain existing patterns in legacy code
- New features use modern patterns exclusively
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep views focused and single-purpose
- Use descriptive names for state enums
- Write SwiftUI code that looks and feels like SwiftUI

## Development Requirements
